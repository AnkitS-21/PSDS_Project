# CONVERSION OF CO2 TO METHANOL

About Project:
The increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have raised significant concerns about climate change and environmental sustainability. One promising approach to mitigating CO₂ accumulation is its utilization in chemical synthesis, particularly in the production of methanol through CO₂ hydrogenation. Methanol is a valuable chemical feedstock widely used in fuel production, energy storage, and the synthesis of formaldehyde, acetic acid, and other industrial chemicals.
This project focuses on modeling and simulating the methanol production process using Aspen Plus. A critical aspect of this study involves selecting an appropriate thermodynamic model to accurately describe phase equilibria and gas solubilities. The RKSMHV2 model was chosen due to its predictive capability and flexibility, and its performance was compared with other models, including NRTL, NRTL-RK, and Peng-Robinson, by generating Txy and Pxy diagrams.
Further, a process flow sheet was developed, incorporating a reactor (RPlug), compressors, and separation units to simulate the methanol synthesis process. The simulation results were analyzed to determine the methanol yield and evaluate the efficiency of different process configurations. This study aims to identify optimal thermodynamic models and process setups that enhance methanol production efficiency while addressing sustainability challenges related to CO₂ utilization.
